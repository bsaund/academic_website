# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate in the Snitkin Lab at the University of Michigan. My thesis research focuses on the genomics and evolution of the bacterial species *C. difficile.* For my thesis I wrote a software package to perform bacterial genome-wide association studies. 

When I'm not in lab I'm probably at UM's Ross School of Business helping out at the Wolverine Venture Fund or olympic weightlifting.
