# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate in the Snitkin Lab at the University of Michigan. I use computational biology approaches and bioinformatics tools to conduct my research. My thesis research focuses on the genomics of the bacterial species *C. difficile.* To support my genomic analyses I contributed to the development of [prewas](https://github.com/Snitkin-Lab-Umich/prewas), a software package that preprocesses called SNPs prior to running bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS). I also wrote a software package to perform bGWAS called [hogwash](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash). 

If I'm not in lab I'm probably at UM's Ross School of Business helping out at the [Wolverine Venture Fund](http://zli.umich.edu/wolverine-venture-fund), quilting, or roller skating.
