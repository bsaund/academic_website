# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate in the Snitkin Lab at the University of Michigan. My thesis research focuses on the genomics of the bacterial species *C. difficile.* To support my genomic analyses I wrote a software package to perform bacterial genome-wide association studies called [hogwash](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash). My degree is in Microbiology & Immunology, but I use computational biology approaches and bioinformatics tools to conduct my research. 

If I'm not in lab I'm probably at UM's Ross School of Business helping out at the [Wolverine Venture Fund](http://zli.umich.edu/wolverine-venture-fund) or olympic weightlifting. 

I'm currently looking for a biotech internship in the Bay Area for summer 2020.
