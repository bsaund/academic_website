# Biography

I'm a PhD candidate in the Snitkin Lab at the University of Michigan. My research interests include bacterial genomics and phylogenetics, with a focus on *C. difficile.* I wrote a software package to perform bacterial genome-wide association studies. When I'm not in lab I'm probably at UM's Ross School of Business helping out at the Wolverine Venture Fund.
