# emoji_DNA
Generate a DNA string of two random emoji each time your terminal starts, like this adorable koala-bear DNA ![](https://github.com/katiesaund/emoji_DNA/blob/master/img/koala_bear_bear.png)

[Download the script from my github page](https://github.com/katiesaund/emoji_DNA). 

To use emoji_dna.sh:  
1) Download emoji_dna.sh  
2) From your terminal add to your bash_profile (`nano ~/.bash_profile`) the line:   
`bash /path/to/emoji_dna.sh`  
3) Source your bash_profile:
`source ~/.bash_profile`  
4) Open a new terminal window and enjoy!   

This little script was a challenge put to me by [Ryan Crawford](https://twitter.com/RDCrawford26) while we discussed both the elegant [Bonsai tree generator for terminal by John Allbritten](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh/tree/master) and the goofy twitter account [@emojiDNA](https://twitter.com/emojiDNA). 


To run the script interactively simply run `bash /path/to/emoji_dna.sh` from your terminal as in the image below. 
I call this creation "Put a Ring on It" ![](https://github.com/katiesaund/emoji_DNA/blob/master/img/put_a_ring_on_it.png).
