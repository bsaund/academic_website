## *The* Venture Capital Competition for Professional Students
The [Venture Capital Investment Competition](https://www.vcic.org/) is the “world’s largest venture capital competition with over 70 universities competing. VCIC is the only place where students get to be VCs for the day.” Though I’m sure student funds, such as the [Dorm Room Fund](https://www.dormroomfund.com/) and [Contrary Capital]( https://contrarycap.com/), would argue that students can be investors while still in school.  

In the competition each university team hears pitches from three businesses and drafts a term sheet for the most promising venture. In February 2019 I traveled with my talented teammates from the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business to Austin to participate in the competition at UT Austin’s McCombs School of Business.  

## An intense day of due diligence 

## Bright and early: Business pitches

## A working lunch: drafting the term sheet

## Selling the deal to 'real' investors

## A heartbreaking loss

## Thanks to the team & our mentors in Ann Arbor
