I've written an open R software package to perform bacterial genome-wide association studies. [Read the wiki](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash/wiki) to learn about it, download the package ([instructions here](https://github.com/katiesaund/hogwash)), and take it for a spin!

It's called hogwash. hoGWASh. Get it?! Tough crowd.
