## Find the best conference you can.
The most proactive step you can take to have an enjoyable poster session is to take the time to choose the best conference for you, your research topic, and your goals. The best conference for you will have lots of attendees with similar research interests to yours. Sometimes this means finding a small, niche conference on your subfield.  

## Customize your conversation to the person’s interest.
It is a waste of your time and others to use the same research pitch on every visitor to your poster. Take the first minute to introduce yourself and to get to know the person who has stopped by your poster. Specifically, I tend to ask what interest the person has in my poster: “What brings you by?” or “Anything you’re particularly interested in?” and about their level of background knowledge: ““Do you also study C. difficile genomics?” or “How closely related is your own research?” These questions lead to higher quality discussions; I avoid explaining a method to a subject area expert and I avoid spewing bioinformatics jargon at a researcher with a wet-lab background. 

## Bring a notepad and paper.

* Jot down suggestions. I’ve been given great ideas for methods to apply to my projects by helpful poster visitors and have been glad to have pen/paper to write on. Sure, I could just tap it into my phone, but that can look rude. More practically, it’s extremely annoying to deal with my phone autocorrecting biology abbreviations and software package names.  
* Collect contact info. You remembered to bring a card, but not everyone will.
* Draw a concept. Having a pad of paper can help you clarify a concept or method to someone from a different research background or when there seems to be a bit of a language barrier. If you look around at the poster session you’ll see lots of scientists gesturing animatedly about their research  with their hands -- this works, but sometimes a piece of paper is the right rool for the job.  

## Pin some business cards to your board. 
People will want to get in touch and you probably didn’t put your email address on your poster (but hopefully you’ve added your twitter handle). Yes, business cards are an expense that not everyone’s work will cover, but they make staying in touch with your new bud easier. 

## If you need accommodations plan for that ahead of time. 
Perhaps a chair to sit in is a necessity; ask to have one at your poster board prior to the start of the session so you don’t lose precious discussion time. You are the expert on what you need to succeed. 

## Have a bottle of water. 
Ideally you’ll be chatting a lot so you’ll need it. Also, if you’re nervous it’s something inconspicuous to fidget with. If traffic to your poster slows down or you just need a minute to yourself to recharge (where are my introverts at?!) you can take a break to refill the bottle.  

## Ask someone to take a photo of you with your poster.
It’s the perfect accomplishment to tweet about and a memory to include in your thesis defense slide deck.

## Freshen up prior to the session. 
Take a look in the mirror, brush your hair & teeth. Check for stains on your slacks or spinach in your teeth. You’re probably fine, but it’s better to be sure. 

## Have a snack in your pocket. 
Do not risk getting hangry with the curious scientists who want to meet you. If you feel hunger pangs gobble down a quick bite to boost your spirits. 

## Hang your poster relatively low. 
At the risk of generalizing: you can make your poster accessible to more readers if you hang it lower rather than higher (short people, people using wheel chairs, stools, or scooters, etc...).

## Interacting with the people at the posters next to yours? Be kind, but don’t hog their time.
I introduce myself as soon as I get to my poster board. I ask them for a quick summary of their project and ask how their conference experience has been. Some people feel it’s an imposition to ask the people near you to explain their research, which seems odd to me, but keep this in mind. I like to pass the time by chatting with the researchers near me because they’re likely to have similar research interests and be wonderful! While we’re chatting I have an eye out for people interested in my poster and keep a smile on my face. 

## Invite people to your poster
Always be self-promoting. Invite people to your poster session (tell them your poster number). If you’ve met someone with similar interests you’re doing them a favor by inviting them; people are at a conference to learn and meet people! 

I used to get a stomache ache just thinking about presenting at a poster session. Now I look forward to them. Good luck at your upcoming poster session!
