# Get Started

In this chapter, we show how to create a simple website from scratch. The website will contain a home page, an "About" page, one R Markdown post, and a plain Markdown post. You will learn the basic concepts for creating websites with **blogdown**. For beginners, we recommend that you get started with the RStudio IDE, but it is not really required. The RStudio IDE can make a few things easier, but you are free to use any editor if you do not care about the extra benefits in RStudio.

## Installation

We assume you have already installed R (https://www.r-project.org) [@R-base] and the RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com). If you do not have RStudio IDE installed, please install Pandoc\index{Pandoc} (http://pandoc.org). Next we need to install the **blogdown** package in R. It is available on CRAN and GitHub, and you can install it with:

```{r}
