abstract = "New approaches to understanding bacterial infections are needed to combat their morbidity and mortality in hospitals. Some of the most significant healthcare-associated bacterial pathogens are dominated by epidemic clones that emerged and spread widely. Attempts to elucidate the mechanistic basis for epidemic potential have been hampered by the limited resolution of molecular assays and an inability to link variation in strain type to variation in clinical phenotypes. Typing studies of *Clostridium difficile*, the most common cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States, have demonstrated that infection-causing isolates are dominated by epidemic lineages but fail to identify the unique factors responsible for the success of these lineages. We hypothesize that these studies have been unsuccessful in part because of the insufficient resolution in standard molecule typing, as evidenced by variation in important in vivo and clinical phenotypes within strains. Current typing methods separate strains based on a subset of their genetic diversity; in contrast, whole genomes sequencing (WGS) offers the highest possible resolution. Using WGS and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach it is now possible to assess the functional impact of genetic variation. A GWAS performed using a set of clinical *C. difficile* isolates has generated preliminary insights into genetic variation associated with clinically relevant *in vitro* phenotypes in *C. difficile*."
